In the past few years WordPress has grown to be arguably the most popular content management systems out there. This growth has been supplemented by a huge number of community-made themes, most of which include some form of advanced back-end customization. The most popular form is a theme options page, but creating one is not as straightforward as you may think. 

In this course youâ€™ll learn the basics of creating your very own theme options page and the result will be a set of tools you can use right away in your own theme.
